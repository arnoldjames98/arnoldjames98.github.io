# Additional Code

Iterations of the dynamics simulation performed included as System Dynamics III within the [Dynamics](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/arnoldjames98.github.io/systemDynamicsAll.ipynb) assignment and as the simulation used for the [Design Optimization](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/arnoldjames98.github.io/designOptimization.ipynb) - Using our dynamics model to determine how to create our prototype with the optimal performance assigment. Only the final iterations of these dynamics simulations are included in the final assignment pages, but it took us many iterations to come to the final dynamics simulation. The two main goals in these iterations were 1) adding compliance to the end-effector link and 2) adding the moving plate to the simulation. Additionally, this is when a second leg was added to the simulation with a constraint that the input links of the two legs must be out of phase. Both Daniel and James worked on these simulations so both of their iterations are included below.
