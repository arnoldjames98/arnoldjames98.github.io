        "In order to make qualitative comparisons of the performance of our physical prototype to that of our simulation, we decided to perform an experiment with the physical prototype that considered the effects of changing the compliance of our longest link. The compliance of this link is the same parameter that used as an input to the optimization that was previously performed on the dynamic simulation. A diagram of the three selected conditions of stiffness for the experiment is shown below:\n",

        "Since our focus is on the design of the legs, we performed our experiment with the legs pointed upwards as they move a plate, rather than the legs being on the ground and the whole system moving. This allows us to control the weight that the legs have to support. Our dynamic simulation and optimization was also performed in this way, and therefore we will be able to more easily compare the results of our experimetn to the results of our simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The plate was selected as a long piece of cardboard since this material would be rigid enough to not bend. Originally, we planned to have the weight of the cardboard plate fully supported by the legs, but the issue was that as the plate moved, its center of weight would eventually not be supported by the four legs, so the plate would tip. The tipping of the plate after the plate moved too far meant that a very small amount of data could be collected since the legs would quickly push the plate far enough that it would tip. Therefore, the plate is also supported by rollers that prevent the tipping of the plate. The addition of these rollers means that the full weight of the plate is not being supported by the legs, but we can simply reduce the weight of the plate in our simulation to make comparisons with the simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the full system prototype, plate, supporting rollers, and the three selected experimental conditions, the final consideration was how to collect the data from the experiements. We decided to use a low-cost motion capture approach. We place markers on the two legs within the field of view of the camera and one to track the motion of the plate. Since the movement of the input link is obstructed in the experiment, additional gears are used to show the angle of the input link. Besides the camera, a lamp was used to provide even lighting to the set-up. The two images of the experimental set-up can be seen below:\n",

These points were the most important to collect since these represent the output of the system. Additionally, the distance that the plate moved will be compared to the integral of horizontal reaction force performance parameter that was selected in the optimization assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to more closely match the dynamics simulation to the experimental set-up, parameters like the weight of the plate and the motor torque needed to be taken into account. However, even with these values, there are some aspects of the simulation that will not perfectly match the experiment. For example, in the simulation, the plate does not move in the horizontal direction. Therefore, the magnitude of the horizontal reaction force from the simulation will have to be compared to the horizontal movement of the plate that can be measured from each experiment. The simulation was set to run for 10s, since the experiments were all run at this same time interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final consideration for comparing the experiments and simulation is determining how to recreate the experimental low, medium, and high stiffness values from the experiment into the simulation. Since our goal is to make qualitative comparisons between the simulation and experiments, we chose to pick three k values that we decided were representative of low, medium, and high stiffness. These three values were picked from our prior knowledge of how changing the k value impacts the results of the simulation which we learned while performing the optimization assignment. We chose this method over trying to experimentally determine the stiffness of the blue links based on the additional of material from the three experiments, since we do not believe perfectly matching these values is critical in order to make a qualitative comparison between be the simulation and experiment.
