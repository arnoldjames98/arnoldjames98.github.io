## Introduction

**Biodegradable Crab Leg Mechanism**  
_Team 1: James Arnold, Katie Brauckmann, Cree Hutcherson, and Daniel Stockwell_   
_(e-mails: {jmarnol6, kbrauckm, chutche1, dcstockw}@asu.edu)_

## Research Question

* How can the concepts of foldable robotics be applied to the design of a crab-inspired, compliant leg mechanism constructed entirely from biodegradable materials?
