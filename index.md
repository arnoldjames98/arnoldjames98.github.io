## Introduction

**Biodegradable Crab Leg Mechanism**  
_Team 1: James Arnold, Katie Brauckmann, Cree Hutcherson, and Daniel Stockwell_   
_(e-mails: {jmarnol6, kbrauckm, chutche1, dcstockw}@asu.edu)_

## Research Question

* How can the concepts of foldable robotics be applied to the design of a crab-inspired, compliant leg mechanism constructed entirely from biodegradable materials?

### Assignments

[Research Question](/assignment1) - Generating and discussing our guiding research question  
[Biomechanics](/assignment2) - Studying and understanding the biological system we chose to focus our design on  
[Kinematics](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/arnoldjames98.github.io/systemKinematics.ipynb) - Creating the kinematic model to estimate the forces/torques, power requirements, and speed of our system  
[Dynamics](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/arnoldjames98.github.io/systemDynamicsAll.ipynb) - Adding in the impedance properties of our system (interia, damping, and stiffness) to understand how the real system will move and react to the envionrment  
[Design and Manufacturing Workflow](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/arnoldjames98.github.io/designManufacturing.ipynb) - Developing the plan for how to create our prototype  
[Design Optimization](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/arnoldjames98.github.io/designOptimization.ipynb) - Using our dynamics model to determine how to create our prototype with the optimal performance  
[Experimental Validation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/arnoldjames98.github.io/dataCollection.ipynb) - Running the experiments with our prototype and performing data analysis to understand the system's performance in real-life
